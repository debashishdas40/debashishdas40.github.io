											<h3>Hotel Booking analysis EDA Project</h3>
											<h3>Problem</h3>
											<p>Have you ever wondered when the best time of year to book a hotel room is? Or the optimal length of stay in order to get the best daily rate? What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests? This hotel booking dataset can help you explore those questions!</p>
											<h4>Conclusion </h4>
											<p>Majority of the guests are from Western Europe. We should spend a
												significant amount of our budget on those area.
												Encourage Direct bookings by offering special discounts
												Majority of the hotels are booked by city hotels. Definitely need to spend the most targeting fund on those hotel.
												3)The number of repeated guests are too low. we should target our advertisement on guests to increase returning guests.
												The majority of reservations converts into successful transactions.
												5)We have also realise that the high rate of cancellations can be due to high no deposit policies.
												We should also target months between May to Aug. Those are peak monthsdue to the summer period.</p>

											<h3>Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction</h3>
											<h3>Problem </h3>
											<p>Description Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.</p>
											<h4> CONCLUSION </h3>      
											<p>CONCLUSION
During the time of our analysis, we initially did EDA on all the features of our datset. We first analysed our dependent variable, 'Rented Bike Count' and also transformed it. Next we analysed categorical variable and dropped the variable who had majority of one class, we also analysed numerical variable, found out the correlation, distribution and their relationship with the dependent variable. We also removed some numerical features who had mostly 0 values and hot encoded the categorical variables.

Next we implemented 7 machine learning algorithms Linear Regression,lasso,ridge,elasticnet,decission tree, Random Forest and XGBoost. We did hyperparameter tuning to improve our model performance. The results of our evaluation are:</p>

											<h3>Health-Insurance-Cross-sell-vehicle-Insurance</h3>
											<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
											<p>
Our client is an Insurance company that has provided Health Insurance to its customers now they need your help in building a model to predict whether the policyholders (customers) from past year will also be interested in Vehicle Insurance provided by the company.

An insurance policy is an arrangement by which a company undertakes to provide a guarantee of compensation for specified loss, damage, illness, or death in return for the payment of a specified premium. A premium is a sum of money that the customer needs to pay regularly to an insurance company for this guarantee.

For example, you may pay a premium of Rs. 5000 each year for a health insurance cover of Rs. 200,000/- so that if, God forbid, you fall ill and need to be hospitalised in that year, the insurance provider company will bear the cost of hospitalisation etc. for upto Rs. 200,000. Now if you are wondering how can company bear such high hospitalisation cost when it charges a premium of only Rs. 5000/-, that is where the concept of probabilities comes in picture. For example, like you, there may be 100 customers who would be paying a premium of Rs. 5000 every year, but only a few of them (say 2-3) would get hospitalised that year and not everyone. This way everyone shares the risk of everyone else.

Just like medical insurance, there is vehicle insurance where every year customer needs to pay a premium of certain amount to insurance provider company so that in case of unfortunate accident by the vehicle, the insurance provider company will provide a compensation (called ‘sum assured’) to the customer.

Building a model to predict whether a customer would be interested in Vehicle Insurance is extremely helpful for the company because it can then accordingly plan its communication strategy to reach out to those customers and optimise its business model and revenue.

Now, in order to predict, whether the customer would be interested in Vehicle insurance, you have information about demographics (gender, age, region code type), Vehicles (Vehicle Age, Damage), Policy (Premium, sourcing channel) etc..</p>
										<h4> CONCLUSION </h3> 
											<p> Some important inferences have been made from the EDA and have been incurred below every visualization.

After training the models and comparing the results, it can be said that the XGBoost Classifier model has performed better than the other models.

Vehicle damage and previously insured came out as the most important features for the model.

This means our model can improve our responce rate for predicting customers who interested in subscribing Vinehicle insurance</p>

											<h3>Netflix-Movies-and-TV-Shows-Clustering</h3>
											<h3>Problem</h3>
											<p>Problem Statement : This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine. In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming service’s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset. Integrating this dataset with other external datasets such as IMDB ratings, rotten tomatoes can also provide many interesting findings..</p>
											<h3>Conclustion</h3>
											<p>Conclusion
Director and cast contains a large number of null values so we will drop these 2 columns .
In this dataset there are two types of contents where 30.86% includes TV shows and the
remaining 69.14% carries Movies. 
3. We have reached a conclusion from our analysis from the content added over years that Netflix is focusing movies and TV shows (Fom 2016 data we get to know that Movies is increased by 80% and TV shows is increased by 73% compare) 
4. From the dataset insights we can conclude that the most number of TV Shows released in 2017 and for Movies it is 2020 
5. On Netflix USA has the largest number of contents. And most of the countries preferred to produce movies more than TV shows. 
6. Most of the movies are belonging to 3 categories 
7. TOP 3 content categories are International movies , dramas , comedies. 
8. In text analysis (NLP) I used stop words, removed punctuations , stemming & TF-IDF vectorizer and other functions of NLP. 9. Applied different clustering models like Kmeans, hierarchical, Agglomerative clustering, DBSCAN on data we got the best cluster arrangements. 
10.By applying different clustering algorithms to our dataset .we get the optimal number of cluster is equal to 3</p>

											<h3>Web scpraping with python</h3>
											<p>
											
										Web scraping is an automatic method to obtain large amounts of data from websites. Most of this data is unstructured data in an HTML format which is then converted into structured data in a spreadsheet or a database so that it can be used in various applications. There are many different ways to perform web scraping to obtain data from websites. These include using online services, particular API’s or even creating your code for web scraping from scratch. </p>
